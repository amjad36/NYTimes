### Why should we choose MVVM over MVC?
â€‹
  1. MVVM pattern extends the MVC pattern. The controller doesn't know about the model, this is what seprates MVC from MVVM.
  2. MVVM pattern presents a better sepration of code by adding view models.
  3. By migrating data manipulation to the view model, testing becomes easier.
  4. The view model provides a transparent communication to the view controller, which it uses to populate the view layer and interact with model layer.
